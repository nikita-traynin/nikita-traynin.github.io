description: I have enjoyed swimming since I was taught it at five years old. I started competing in middle school, and in high school, I tried out for the team and made varsity. When I enrolled in TAMS, I put my competitive side to rest, but continued practicing. Swimming has been one of the biggest character-molding aspects of my life, and I still like to hop in for a few laps here and there.
