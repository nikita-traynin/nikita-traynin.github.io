Hi! My name's Nikita - I'm a programmer and budding data scientist studying for my Bachelor's at UTD. 
Originally from Houston, I reside in Richardson, TX during the school year and come back home for breaks. <br><br>
Check out this website to find out more about my passions and projects I've completed or worked on, and feel free 
to reach out to me for any questions or inquiries. <br><br>
